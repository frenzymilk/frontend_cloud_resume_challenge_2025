# frontend_cloud_resume_challenge_2025
You are currently on the Frontend repo of my iteration of the Cloud Resume Challenge from Forrest Brazeal, a fully serverless, automated resume website using AWS.
Go here for the [Backend](https://github.com/frenzymilk/backend_cloud_resume_challenge_2025).

Here’s what I delivered:

✅ Multi-account AWS environment built using AWS Organizations
• Root actions restricted
• Accounts prevented from leaving the org
• Billing alarms at multiple tiers with SNS email alerts

✅ Serverless resume website
• Static site in S3 served securely via CloudFront
• API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB for a dynamic visitor counter

✅ Automation + Infrastructure as Code
• Full deployment via Terraform
• GitHub Actions CI/CD automatically syncs changed files to S3
• CloudFront cache invalidation triggered only for updated assets

✅ Security and IAM as a first-class requirement
• Fine-grained IAM policies for least-privilege access
• Clear separation between users, roles, and service permissions
• HTTPS enforced and no public backend access
